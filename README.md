Manual implementation of Snake in C
This is a **manual implementation** of the Snake game in C when I am a freshman in college. It implements most of the features of the Snake game.

In addition, you can change the background music in the file. Simply replace "朝日.mp3" with what you want and rename the music to "朝日.mp3".

1.0 version was the first version I created,which is not perfect. **I suggest you play the 1.1 version**，to which I add some new features and **hope you enjoy it**!

Since it's the first game I've designed, the code maybe not good. And for time reasons,**I probably won't maintain it anymore!**
